The Orchestration Log:

- I initially attempted to apply a strategy file at the workspace root but a patch error occurred (missing parameters and an invalid path); I corrected this by reapplying the patch to `/NJIT/2026/AGENTS.md` and confirming the file creation.
- I also preserved the original README content in `README_ARCHIVE.md` so the scaffold notes remain available.
- I also had some permission errors trying to connect the local files to the github repo, but eventually I was able to pull and commit, then push the changes.
