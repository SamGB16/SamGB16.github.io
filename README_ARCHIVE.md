Site scaffold (archived original README)

Original README content moved here on 2026-02-12.

Site scaffold for review — no logic added yet.

Please review the file structure below and reply with any changes before I implement interactive logic or styling.

Structure:
- index.html — Hero, links to resume and projects (placeholder content)
- css/style.css — placeholder stylesheet
- resume/README.md — place `resume.pdf` here when ready
- projects/README.md — projects index
- projects/calculator/README.md — links to live demo and repo
- assets/ — screenshots and diagrams

Approval checklist:
- Confirm file structure
- Provide `resume.pdf` (optional now)
- Provide 2–3 screenshots for Projects (optional now)

After you approve, I will add content, styles, and then small deploy config for Netlify.
